## FINAL PROJECT - CodeBlock

### Project Brief

A Modular Programming Prototyping Kit that could help users to interact and learn about p5.js. 
The Kit includes Value Modular, Shape Modular, and For Loop Modular. The user could connect Value Modular with SHape Modular to change the position, size. Also Connect Value Moduler and Shape Modular with For Loop Modular to run the for loop

### Hardware
- Atom3 Board * 2
- Potentiometer * 5
- light sensor * 1
- wire * n

Wireconnection of Value Module
